# Project-Kazamata

I am also creating a CLI for this framework [here](https://github.com/oldmartijntje/Kazamata-CLI)

This is a HTML-JS project for me to learn HTML Canvas.

To run locally:
```
npm run dev
```

Follow [these steps](https://github.com/sitek94/vite-deploy-demo) to host to github pages. (the Vite app and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` already exist)
