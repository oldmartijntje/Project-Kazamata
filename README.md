# Project-Kazamata
This is a HTML-JS project for me to learn HTML Canvas.

I am going to follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmxNrlPx8iY) tutorial for the kickstart, but then probably will twist it towards my design.

To run locally:
```
npm run dev
```

Follow [these steps](https://github.com/sitek94/vite-deploy-demo) to host to github pages. (the Vite app and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` already exist)
