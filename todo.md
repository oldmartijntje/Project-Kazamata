- [ ] a file with all Event `const` variables
- [ ] use states for things like picking up, instead of seperate checks etc for every single option
- [ ] rename HERO to PLAYER
- [ ] make player things (item pickup and inventory) an Entity class instead of Player
- [ ] places with 'nextId', either use UUID or make it loadable for savestates (cause now it always starts at 0)
